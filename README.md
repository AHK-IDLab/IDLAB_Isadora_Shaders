# Idlab Isadora Shaders
Some GLSL actors for Isadora made with the support of IDLAB at the AHK Amsterdam

# Idlab
Idlab is the Interdisciplinary Digital Laboratory situated at the Academy of Theatre and Dance AHK Amsterdam.

The Idlab has supported the creation of these effects through its Artist In Residency program in March 2020.

The code in these effects was adapted from 2 main sources:
https://github.com/maxillacult/ofxPostGlitch
and
https://github.com/neilmendoza/ofxPostProcessing


# Installation

Download or clone this repository.

Open Isadora and go to Help ->  Open Plugin Folder -> Troika Tronix GLSL Shaders

Copy the contents of the shader folder into the Troika Tronix GLSL Shaders folder

Restart Isadora

There is a sample Isadora patch to illustrate some usage, but I am sure you can be more creative.

Please post videos or pictures of what you do with this to the Isadora forum thread:

Have fun!
